# Project_August
this the source code that created for autonomous delivery and cv detection.


# Step 001: Make sure that you have the PX4, GAZEBO, ROS, MAVROS simulation environment set up!
If not, please check the site: [XTDrone Manual](https://www.yuque.com/xtdrone/manual_cn)

# Step 002: Implement that offboard example on your own:
Please check the site: [PX4 offboard example](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/ros/mavros_offboard_python.html)
that prerequisites are MAVROS ROS and Python basics.
the topics can be found in [MAVROS Topics](http://wiki.ros.org/mavros)
GAAS tutorial E01 which is optional is also a good choice for implementing that offboard example.
GAAS E01 ->[GAAS E01](https://gaas.gitbook.io/guide/software-realization-build-your-own-autonomous-drone/wu-ren-ji-zi-dong-jia-shi-xi-lie-offboard-kong-zhi-yi-ji-gazebo-fang-zhen)

# Step 003: Write your own ROS Node to control your UAV whatever you want
Supposing that GAAS had write an API for controling PX4, I guess you must make sure that you have totally understand how subscriber, publisher and topics work and make some changes to python file `px4_mavros_run.py` and `commander.py`.


# Make sure that you have Yolov5 Environment Set Up!
If not, please check: [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
